methods: "SEIR-like epidemic model with vaccination, variants of concern, and explicit race/etnicity demographic and contact structure."
methods_long: "The model is a compartmental SEIR-like model with the addition of compartments for vaccination and deaths. The model also accounts for the modulating effect of NPIs on transmission considering mobility data, and the emergence of more transmissible variants of concern. The model considers an explicit demographic representation and contact structure of different race/etnicities. The model is calibrated to the observed deaths using an Approximate Bayesian Computation approach."
